# Blockchain Development

This project involves writing and deploying a smart contract using Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract will include features such as token creation, transfer, and voting mechanisms. Additionally, the project involves building a frontend application to interact with the smart contract, allowing users to perform these actions through a user-friendly interface.

<br/>

## Features

- __Smart Contract Development__: Write a smart contract in Solidity to handle token creation, transfer, and voting.
- __Token Creation__: Implement functionality to create and manage tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
- __Token Transfer__: Enable users to transfer tokens between accounts.
- __Voting Mechanism__: Implement a voting system within the smart contract.
- __Frontend Integration__: Develop a frontend application to interact with the smart contract, providing a seamless user experience.

<br/>

## Utility Functions

- __Smart Contract Functions__: Functions to handle token creation, transfer, and voting within the smart contract.
- __Web3 Integration__: Functions to interact with the Ethereum blockchain using Web3.js or Ethers.js.
- __Frontend Components__: Components to display and interact with the smart contract functionalities in the frontend application.
- __Event Handling__: Functions to handle and display events emitted by the smart contract.

<br/>

## Implementation

- __Smart Contract Development__: Write the smart contract in Solidity. Implement functions for token creation, transfer, and voting. Deploy the contract on the Ethereum test network (e.g., Rinkeby or Ropsten).
- __Web3 Integration__: Use Web3.js or Ethers.js to interact with the deployed smart contract from a frontend application.
- __Frontend Development__: Build a frontend application using a framework like React. Integrate Web3.js or Ethers.js to enable interactions with the smart contract.
- __Event Handling__: Implement functions to listen for and handle events emitted by the smart contract (e.g., Transfer events, Vote events).

## API Reference

#### __Create Token Endpoint__: Creates a new token with the specified initial supply and assigns it to the contract owner.

```http
POST /createToken
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `initialSupply`| `integer` | **Required**. The initial supply of the token.|


#### __Transfer Token Endpoint__: Transfers the specified amount of tokens to the specified address.

```http
POST /transfer
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `to`| `string` | **Required**. The address to transfer tokens to.|
| `amount`| `integer` | **Required**. The number of tokens to transfer.|


#### __Vote Endpoint__: User to vote on a proposal identified by its ID.

```http
POST /vote
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `proposalId`| `integer` | **Required**. The ID of the proposal to vote on.|

## Testing

- __Unit Testing__: Test individual functions of the smart contract to ensure they work as expected.
- __Integration Testing__: Test the interaction between the frontend application and the smart contract.
- __Performance Testing__: Measure the performance of smart contract operations on the Ethereum network.
- __Security Testing__: Validate the security of the smart contract to prevent vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks.

<br/>

## Example Scenarios

- __Token Creation__: Deploy the smart contract and create a new token. Verify that the total supply is correctly initialized and that the owner holds the initial supply.
- __Token Transfer__: Transfer tokens from one account to another and verify that balances are updated correctly.
- __Voting__: Implement a voting mechanism where users can vote on proposals. Verify that votes are counted correctly and that results are accurately reported.
- __Frontend Interaction__: Use the frontend application to create tokens, transfer tokens, and participate in voting. Verify that all interactions with the smart contract are successful.
